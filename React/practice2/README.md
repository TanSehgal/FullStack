# Library Management UI with Search, Add, and Remove Book Functionality

## Objective
Build an interactive library management interface using React that allows users to view a list of books and perform actions like searching, adding, and removing books. This task strengthens your understanding of state management, event handling, and dynamic rendering in React.

## Task Description
Create a React-based UI that displays a list of books (each with a title and author). Add a search input box to filter books by title or author as the user types. Provide an input form to add new books to the list, and include a remove button next to each book to delete it from the list. All actions (searching, adding, removing) should work dynamically without reloading the page, demonstrating React's ability to update the UI based on state changes.
