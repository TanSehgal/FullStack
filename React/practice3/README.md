# Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses

## Objective
Understand and apply the concept of inheritance in JavaScript (ES6 classes) by creating a base class and extending it into specialized subclasses. This helps build strong foundational skills in object-oriented programming within a modern JavaScript context.

## Task Description
Create a base Person class that has properties like name and age, and a method to display basic information. Then, create two subclasses: Student and Teacher, each extending Person. The Student class should include an additional property like grade or course, and the Teacher class should include a property like subject or department. Each subclass should override or extend methods as needed to display complete details. Finally, create instances of both subclasses and demonstrate calling their methods to show how inheritance and method overriding work.
